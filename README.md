## About

Svensk Databas is a Swedish transparency project that investigates where Swedish brands actually manufacture their products. Many brands market themselves with Swedish heritage, but are their products really made in Sweden?

This database categorizes brands into three groups:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Ja** (Yes) | Products are manufactured in Sweden |
| **Nej** (No) | Products are not manufactured in Sweden |
| **Delvis** (Partially) | Some products are made in Sweden, others are not |

## Purpose

The goal is to create transparency around "Made in Sweden" claims. Consumers deserve to know where products actually come from, regardless of how a brand positions itself.

## Features

- Search and filter brands by name or category
- View detailed information about each brand including:
  - Parent company (Moderbolag)
  - Ownership structure (Ägare)
  - Stock listing status (Börsnoterat)
  - Manufacturing countries (Tillverkningsländer)
  - Corporate structure (Koncernstruktur)

## Future Plans

- Visualize company structures and ownership hierarchies
- Map relationships between brands, parent companies, and investors
- Expand the database with more Swedish brands
- Add data visualization showing manufacturing distribution

## Tech Stack

- React + TypeScript
- Vite
- Vanilla CSS with M3 Layout System

npm install      # Install dependencies
